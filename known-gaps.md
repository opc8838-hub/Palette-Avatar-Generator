# Known fidelity gaps

This artifact is a local `PIPELINE_REPLAY` using public page-delivered assets. It is not a redistribution of the Apple Lotus viewer runtime.

| Area | Source behavior | Local behavior | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hinge | A Lotus `Hinge` component applies magnetic/spring settling. | Slider time is mapped directly to the delivered `Slider` clip. | The trajectory is continuous, but its final easing and hinge physics are approximate. |
| Screen render | `WallpaperRenderer`, `Wipe`, and `FadeThroughBlack` drive screen presentation under a fixed authored camera. | Original wallpaper layers and UI resources feed two-pass bicubic blur; screen materials add local-planar parallax and a hinge-centered radial shadow. | Free orbit uses a UV anchor to keep content covering the device at camera angles the source scene never authored. |
| Material passes | Lotus assigns six environment layers, replaces selected AO bindings, and applies separate scene-level opacity/exposure chunks. | Three.js restores the delivered AO references, layer 4/5 Optics/Finish EXRs, source rotations, Logo visibility and camera-glass transparency; layers 0–2 share the Finish fallback with restrained diffuse fill. | Fine highlight travel can still differ from Lotus's dynamic light-card interpolation, but black trim, Logo, occlusion and optics no longer fall back to bare-glTF rendering. |
| Named state camera | Source state changes use Lotus camera composition. | The local camera starts with source constraints and remains freely controllable. | The state pose is research-aligned rather than pixel-matched. |

The source pose images remain in `assets/` only as analysis references. They are deliberately absent from the runtime DOM and cannot replace the interactive model.
