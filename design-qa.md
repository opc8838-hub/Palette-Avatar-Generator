# Duo Mock — React migration acceptance

## Scope and source of truth

Reference: user-provided duo studio screenshot, codex-clipboard-e4b2b8d4-9882-4cbb-9f1a-3614558f1def.png.
Later explicit user instructions override its details: six poses, Closed first/default, previous Phosphor icons, a single icon-only segmented bar, fold slider inside Add your design, no Cinematic/footer/gesture captions, TikTok Display brand title.

The user explicitly stated “已经验收完毕 push” on 2026-09-11. No further visual changes were made after acceptance.

## Evidence observed by this agent

- Vite production build passed. React/Tailwind/shadcn are bundled, and original GLTF/EXR/shader/decoder resources are copied into dist.
- Real browser at http://localhost:4174/ loaded the production output and rendered a single WebGL canvas.
- Initial DOM: Closed checked, six radios in the requested order, empty visible text in every segment. Main visible text reduced to Duo Mock, Add your design and Export.
- Initial screenshot at 1084×998 showed the closed model centered, TikTok Display wordmark, inset selected segment and no footer/Cinematic.
- Computed heading font-family was TikTok Display, Geist Variable, sans-serif. Both font files were valid WOFF binaries and appeared in the production build.
- All six poses were selected and inspected. Captures made during transitions were distinguished from settled Portrait and Standing captures.
- Fold angle is inside the design popover. End key set aria-valuenow=1; the model remained fully unfolded in the following screenshot, with no image handoff.
- The image picker accepted a local JPG and entered the image-decoding state. Follow-up crop/export inspection was interrupted by the browser authorization boundary; this is not recorded as a completed upload/export assertion.
- Node test: 6/6 passed. Covers Closed/six-state contract, independent screen crop options, late renderer binding, import race, clear-while-loading and invalid/oversized/undecodable input. Image.decode is a controlled test double, not a browser decoding proof.
- git diff --check passed.

## Acceptance boundary

The new React wiring for PNG export and the final narrow-screen layout were not fully re-tested by this agent after the browser blocked the additional preview access. The user then confirmed acceptance and requested push, ending further browser verification.

No final side-by-side normalized image comparison was completed. This report does not claim pixel parity with the original reference, mobile device coverage, a React-driven WebGL speedup, or new anti-aliasing/material improvements.

The pre-existing shared scene/materials and alpha-cropped PNG exporter are retained. Automatic centering's first-frame binding-matrix fix was verified in the rendered default view. Browser console errors from the first cached development navigation were resolved before the successful production load.

## Remaining technical notes

- Vite warns about the roughly 1.12 MB minified JS chunk (about 328 KB gzip), chiefly the local Three.js runtime plus UI. This is a bundle-size warning, not a build failure or measured frame-rate regression.
- At manually enlarged or transient diagonal views, a device may approach the canvas boundary; the user retains zoom and reset controls.
- Model/media/font rights are unchanged by this independent study.
- The independent untracked prototypes/ directory was not part of this delivery and is not staged.

## Public build follow-up

The initial Git-triggered deploy failed because all 495 lockfile tarball URLs pointed to bnpm.byted.org, which Vercel could not resolve. The URLs were normalized to registry.npmjs.org without changing package versions or integrity hashes, and a repository .npmrc now pins that public source.

An isolated archive of the accepted commit, with only this registry correction, passed npm ci, the production build and all 6 tests. Concurrent camera-lens/prototype development in the working tree was excluded from the release.
